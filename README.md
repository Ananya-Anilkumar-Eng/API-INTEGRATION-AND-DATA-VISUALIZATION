# DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on obtaining external data from a public api and based on the obtained data, data visualization was done. The public api I have used --https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/states-- which contains the data of COVID-19 cases for all the US states. By importing the necessary modules, I have performed few histogram, bargraph,scatter plots, categorical and relational plots(normal curves) and 3D plots.

The task was performed in _**Jupyter Notebook**_ and can also be performed in _**Python IDLE, Spyder, VS Code**_ with necessary modules available.The modules used are _** requests, pandas, warnings, matplotlib and seaborn**_.
