# DESCRIPTION

This project focuses on obtaining external data from a public api and based on the obtained data, data visualization was done. The public api I have use--https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/states--which contains the data of COVID-19 cases in the US states. By importing the necessary modules, I have performed few histogram, bargraph,scatter plots, categorical and relational plots(normal curves) and 3D plots.
